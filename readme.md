# my dwm config
I was programming in Ruby and was getting really annoyed with i3's window splitting and movements. So I spent the entire day learning dwm instead!

The goal of this is to just configure it, and then leave it for a long period of time. Although the commit history doesn't look like it, I don't really like to change my config that much at the moment, and the frustrations of dwm make that possible!!
